## Description

```This project is curated for car owners with questions about their vehicle. Checking the user manual might take some time if it is available to you, rather than skip through the manual's pages just ask your AI mechanic a quick question. Users can ask DIY questions and receive exact steps to get their project completed or just a general question like "How often should i change my engine air filter?"```

## Motivation for Development

```As an automotive enthusiast I'm always looking for innovative ways to increase the average person's knowledge about cars.```

## Tools/Technologies used:

- Open AI
- Node.js
- Inquirer
- Langchain
- VSC
- Github


## User Story

As an average car owner with little to no automotive knowledge I need an app that can answer any general knowledge questions about my vehicle, that will also give me steps to complete simple DIY repairs, etc.
